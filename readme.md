# Overview of GIS for Non-Profits

## Format
A 2-hour hands-on workshop introducing the basics of loading and visualizing data in QGIS for those with little to no experience working with spatial data

## Summary
Once confined to highly-trained experts using sophisticated (and expensive) tools, spatial analysis and mapmaking have increasingly become democratized (and cheaper). With the proliferation of open data, particularly data rich with spatial information, it's now more essential than ever that data users understand how to leverage GIS tools for timely and accurate analysis of important information. Join us for a workshop introducing the basics of mapping using open data and open-source tools, focused on use-cases for non-profit organizations. At the end of our 2-hour session, you'll have downloaded and visualized data for and about your community, beginning your journey to telling true and compelling stories with spatial data.
